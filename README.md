Abstract

The quality of life can be divided into four categories according to the engaged theory, and those domains are politics, ecology, culture, and economics. The goal of this project was to figure out which domains, if any, correlate the most with the quality of life, along with which aspects under each domain effects the quality of life index the most. The last goal was to analyze how online sources, such as Wikipedia, define the quality of life in relation to the four domains. This was done through studying a numerical dataset called "Socio-Economic Country Profiles" and textual data in the form of multiple Wikipedia pages. The numerical dataset was analyzed using the Spearman correlation coefficient and Seaborn to create scatterplots after dividing the data. The textual data was studied through word frequencies, in addition to word embeddings. Through this research, it was found that the numerical data emphasized economics and culture although the data itself did not represent all the domains equally, while the textual data contained many words relating to politics and culture. Using similarity values, it was found that the domains may all depend on one another and work together to impact the quality of life index.
